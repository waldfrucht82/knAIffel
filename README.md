## Single Comprehensive Prompt

This is the single prompt that will generate the exact Kniffel (Yahtzee) game found in this repository:
> Create a browser-based Kniffel (Yahtzee) game for multiple players, optimized for smartphone displays, with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The game should include the following features:  
**Dynamic Player Setup:**  
Before the game starts, allow the user to input the number of players (minimum 2). Use a number input and a 'Start Game' button. Dynamically create player indicators based on the input. Hide the setup area and show the game area when the game starts.  
Dice Rolling: Display five dice using SVG images for each side (1-6). Clicking a die will select/deselect it for the next roll, highlighting it visually. A 'Roll Dice' button will roll only unselected dice. Track and display the number of rolls remaining (3 per turn).  
**Scoreboard:**  
Use a single table with a 'Category' column and a score column for each player.  
Categories: Aces (1), Twos (2), Threes (3), Fours (4), Fives (5), Sixes (6), Bonus, Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Kniffel, Chance, Total.  
Highlight the score column of the currently active player.  
Players can only assign scores to their own columns.
Calculate the bonus automatically, assigning it as soon as the player's total score in the number categories reaches 63 or more. This bonus assignment should not trigger a player switch or a game end check.  
When the game has ended, write the name of the winning player and the final score into the first cell of the 'Total' row. The winning score should include the bonus. The game should end when all categories other than the bonus have been filled.  
The "Total" and "Bonus" categories should not be clickable or assignable.  
**Game Logic:**  
Switch between players after each turn when a non bonus score is assigned.  
Prevent scoring into an already assigned category.  
Detect when all categories (excluding bonus) have been filled, declare a winner or a tie.  
> **User Interface:**  
>   * Optimize for smartphone displays using CSS media queries, with a compact layout and minimal scrolling.  
>   * The 'Kniffel' heading should be at the very top of the page and be reduced in size.  
>   * Text must be readable for people with visual impairments.  
>   * A 'Restart Game' button at the bottom of the page should reset all scores, categories, and player information, allowing a new game to begin using the same amount of players.  
> * The columns must not duplicate when restarting.
>
> **Language:** Translate the entire website (all text, messages) into German.  
> **Dice Images:** Use inline SVG code for the dice images.  

## Potential Improvements

*   Add animations to the dice rolls.
*   Implement user interface enhancements.
*   Create better game-end UI elements.
